The Builder Design Pattern is a creational pattern used in software design to construct a complex object step by step. It allows the construction of a product in a step-by-step manner, where the construction process can change based on the type of product being built. This pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
