The Strategy Design Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable, allowing clients to switch algorithms dynamically without altering the code structure.

# What is the Strategy Design Pattern?
The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms or behaviors, put each of them in a separate class, and make them interchangeable at runtime. This pattern is useful when you want to dynamically change the behavior of a class without modifying its code.

## Characteristics of this design pattern
This pattern exhibits several key characteristics, such as:

Defines a family of algorithms: The pattern allows you to encapsulate multiple algorithms or behaviors into separate classes, known as strategies.
Encapsulates behaviors: Each strategy encapsulates a specific behavior or algorithm, providing a clean and modular way to manage different variations or implementations.
Enables dynamic behavior switching: The pattern enables clients to switch between different strategies at runtime, allowing for flexible and dynamic behavior changes.
Promotes object collaboration: The pattern encourages collaboration between a context object and strategy objects, where the context delegates the execution of a behavior to a strategy object.

## Components of the Strategy Design Pattern
1. Context
A class or object known as the Context assigns the task to a strategy object and contains a reference to it.

It serves as an intermediary between the client and the strategy, offering an integrated approach for task execution without exposing every detail of the process.
The Context maintains a reference to a strategy object and calls its methods to perform the task, allowing for interchangeable strategies to be used.

2. Strategy Interface
An abstract class or interface known as the Strategy Interface specifies a set of methods that all concrete strategies must implement.

As a kind of agreement, it guarantees that all strategies follow the same set of rules and are interchangeable by the Context.
The Strategy Interface promotes flexibility and modularity in the design by establishing a common interface that enables decoupling between the Context and the specific strategies.


3. Concrete Strategies
Concrete Strategies are the various implementations of the Strategy Interface. Each concrete strategy provides a specific algorithm or behavior for performing the task defined by the Strategy Interface.

Concrete strategies encapsulate the details of their respective algorithms and provide a method for executing the task.
They are interchangeable and can be selected and configured by the client based on the requirements of the task.

4. Client:
The Client is responsible for selecting and configuring the appropriate strategy and providing it to the Context.

It knows the requirements of the task and decides which strategy to use based on those requirements.
The client creates an instance of the desired concrete strategy and passes it to the Context, enabling the Context to use the selected strategy to perform the task.

## Communication between the Components
In the Strategy Design Pattern, communication between the components occurs in a structured and decoupled manner. Here's how the components interact with each other:

Client to Context:
The Client, which knows the requirements of the task, interacts with the Context to initiate the task execution.
The Client selects an appropriate strategy based on the task requirements and provides it to the Context.
The Client may configure the selected strategy before passing it to the Context if necessary.
Context to Strategy:
The Context holds a reference to the selected strategy and delegates the task to it.
The Context invokes a method on the strategy object, triggering the execution of the specific algorithm or behavior encapsulated within the strategy.
Strategy to Context:
Once the strategy completes its execution, it may return a result or perform any necessary actions.
The strategy communicates the result or any relevant information back to the Context, which may further process or utilize the result as needed.
Strategy Interface as Contract:
The Strategy Interface serves as a contract that defines a set of methods that all concrete strategies must implement.
The Context communicates with strategies through the common interface, promoting interchangeability and decoupling.
Decoupled Communication:
Since the components' communication is decoupled, the Context is not required to be aware of the exact details of how each strategy carries out the task.
As long as they follow the same interface, strategies can be switched or replaced without affecting the client or other strategies.

## Challenges Without Using Strategy Pattern:
Limited Flexibility: Implementing sorting algorithms directly within the main sorting class can make the code inflexible. Adding new sorting algorithms or changing existing ones would require modifying the main class, which violates the Open/Closed Principle.
Code Duplication: Without a clear structure, you may end up duplicating sorting logic to handle different algorithms.
Hard-Coded Logic: Implementing sorting logic directly within the main sorting class can make the code rigid and difficult to extend or modify.

## How Strategy Pattern helps to solve above challenges?
Here's how the Strategy Pattern helps:

Code Reusability: By encapsulating sorting algorithms into separate strategy classes, you can reuse these strategies across different parts of the system. This reduces code duplication and promotes maintainability.
Flexibility and Extensibility: The Strategy Pattern makes it simple to adapt or add new sorting algorithms without changing the existing code. Since each strategy is independent, it is possible to change or expand it without impacting other system components.
Separation of Concerns: The Strategy Pattern separates sorting logic into distinct strategy classes, which encourages a clear division of responsibilities. As a result, the code is easier to test, and maintain.

## When to use the Strategy Design Pattern?
Here are some situations where you should consider using the Strategy pattern:

Multiple Algorithms: When you have multiple algorithms that can be used interchangeably based on different contexts, such as sorting algorithms (bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort), searching algorithms, compression algorithms, etc.
Encapsulating Algorithms: When you want to encapsulate the implementation details of algorithms separately from the context that uses them, allowing for easier maintenance, testing, and modification of algorithms without affecting the client code.
Runtime Selection: When you need to dynamically select and switch between different algorithms at runtime based on user preferences, configuration settings, or system states.
Reducing Conditional Statements: When you have a class with multiple conditional statements that choose between different behaviors, using the Strategy pattern helps in eliminating the need for conditional statements and making the code more modular and maintainable.
Testing and Extensibility: When you want to facilitate easier unit testing by enabling the substitution of algorithms with mock objects or stubs. Additionally, the Strategy pattern makes it easier to extend the system with new algorithms without modifying existing code.

## When not to use the Strategy Design Pattern?
Here are some situations where you should consider not using the Strategy pattern:

Single Algorithm: If there is only one fixed algorithm that will be used throughout the lifetime of the application, and there is no need for dynamic selection or switching between algorithms, using the Strategy pattern might introduce unnecessary complexity.
Overhead:If the overhead of implementing multiple strategies outweighs the benefits, especially in simple scenarios where direct implementation without the Strategy pattern is more straightforward and clear.
Inflexible Context: If the context class tightly depends on a single algorithm and there is no need for flexibility or interchangeability, using the Strategy pattern may introduce unnecessary abstraction and complexity.


## Advantages of the Strategy Design Pattern
Below are the advantages of the strategy design pattern:

A family of algorithms can be defined as a class hierarchy and can be used interchangeably to alter application behavior without changing its architecture.
By encapsulating the algorithm separately, new algorithms complying with the same interface can be easily introduced.
The application can switch strategies at run-time.
Strategy enables the clients to choose the required algorithm, without using a "switch" statement or a series of "if-else" statements.
Data structures used for implementing the algorithm are completely encapsulated in Strategy classes. Therefore, the implementation of an algorithm can be changed without affecting the Context class.

## Disadvantages of the Strategy Design Pattern
Below are the disadvantages of the strategy design pattern:

The application must be aware of all the strategies to select the right one for the right situation.
Context and the Strategy classes normally communicate through the interface specified by the abstract Strategy base class. Strategy base class must expose interface for all the required behaviours, which some concrete Strategy classes might not implement.
In most cases, the application configures the Context with the required Strategy object. Therefore, the application needs to create and maintain two objects in place of one.

## Use cases of Strategy Method Design Pattern in Java
Here are some common use cases for the Strategy Method Pattern:

File Format Converters: Suppose we have an application that needs to convert data between different file formats (e.g., CSV to JSON, XML to YAML). we can use the Strategy Pattern to define a family of algorithms for each conversion strategy.
Algorithm Variations: Sorting Algorithms: If we have a sorting algorithm that needs to be interchangeable (e.g., bubble sort, quicksort, mergesort), we can use the Strategy Pattern to encapsulate each sorting algorithm as a separate strategy.
Searching Algorithms: Similar to sorting, we can have different search algorithms (linear search, binary search, etc.) encapsulated as strategies.
Payment Gateways: In a payment processing system, you might have different payment gateways (e.g., PayPal, Stripe, Square). Using the Strategy Pattern, we can encapsulate the logic for each payment gateway as a separate strategy, allowing the system to switch between different payment methods easily.
Compression Algorithms: If we are working with a system that involves compressing and decompressing data, different compression algorithms (e.g., gzip, zlib, lzma) can be implemented as separate strategies.
